# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we will use multiple linear regression to explore the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. To accomplish this, we will perform a complete multiple linear regression analysis, which includes exploring and cleaning data, using plots and descriptive statistics to select the independent variables, creating and fitting a model, checking model assumptions, analyzing model performance, interpreting model ouputs and communicating results to stakeholders.

For this project, we will be analyzing a small businessâ€™ historical marketing promotion data. Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where their business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales. Based on this information, leaders in the company will make decisions about where to focus future marketing efforts.
